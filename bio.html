					ELEEN HALVORSEN
					Born and  raised in Norway, Eleen Halvorsen moved to New York to attend Parsons The New School for Design, from where she graduated in 2012. In April  2013 she launched her namesake label with the conceptual capsule collection Dancing Under The Black Moon.</p>
				<p>
					Upon graduation ELEEN was among the selected graduates to show at Parsons' Benefit Exhibition at The Chelsea Piers in 2012. ELEEN was also one of the finalists in the annual international Arts of Fashion Competition 2012, hosted by The Arts of Fashion Foundation in San Francisco. In October 2013 she was part of the curated group show BLEND hosted by Beautiful Savage Magazine and REVERSE.</p>
				<p>
					ELEEN HALVORSEN has a conceptual approach to design and by experimenting with unconventional patternmaking,construction and materials she is constantly seeking interesting  new juxtapositions. And with a background form the clear winter sky - and the mysterious nature of Scandinavia, influenced by the grittiness of the streets of New York City, ELEEN HALVORSEN has morphed into a dark minimalistic, yet eccentric line.</p>
				<p>  
				THE COLLECTIONS
				ELEEN HALVORSEN's collections are generally recognized by contrast, exploration and manipulation of  
              	traditional, as well as unconventional, material. Intricate hand sewn yarn garments and wrinkled "second     
              	skin" leather, juxtaposed to clean-cut, minimalistic garments. The contrast between soft and hard,   
              	sculptural and flowy, technical and natural fabrics are key components in ELEEN's work</p>
