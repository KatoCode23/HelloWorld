				ELEEN HALVORSEN
				Born and raised in Norway, Eleen Halvorsen moved to New York to attend Parsons The New School for Design, from where she graduated in 2012. In April 2013 she launched her namesake label with the conceptual capsule collection Dancing Under 
				The Black Moon.</p>
			<p>
				Upon graduation ELEEN was among the selected graduates to show at Parsons'Benefit Exhibition at The Chelsea Piers. ELEEN was also one of the finalists in the annual international Arts of Fashion Competition 2012, hosted by The Arts of Fashion Foundation in San Francisco. In October 2013 she was part of the curated group show BLEND hosted by Beautiful Savage Magazine and REVERSE. Since her launch Eleen Halvorsen has achieved editorial and written coverage from top publications including: Interview, Numero Tokyo, SCHON,  StyleZeitgeist, Bullett Magazine Huffington Post and Refinery29.</p>
			<p>
				ELEEN HALVORSEN has a conceptual approach to design and by experimenting with unconventional patternmaking, construction and materials she is constantly seeking interesting new juxtapositions. The result of this constant search for contrast and novelty, together with her distinct aesthetic, is essential in positioning Eleen Halvorsen as a dark minimalistic, yet eccentric line.</p>
