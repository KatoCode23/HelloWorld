		<div class="bio-text hide">
			<p>Kalen Imani Norton. Born and Raised in Long Beach, Ca on October 29,1981. 33 years of age. Son of Kimberlee Renee Norton and Kenneth Dwayne Norton. Brother and eldest sibling to 3 beautiful sisters. Leadership and inspiration come naturally.</p><p> As a former professional baseball player I have always had a passion for athletics. A 1 year NASM certified personal trainer and life long fitness enthusiast. Kato attacks fitness in an open minded, competitive, and enthusiastic fashion. Assessing the objectives of the client and implementing specific workout regiments in and outside training sessions. Constructing day to day interactive programs that translate into results. Kato has a no quick fix mentality. No limitless pills here. Just hard work that pays off. Dividends.</p><p> Kato will hand you a lifestyle you can be proud of forever. AND you'll look good too. Like most after highschool I had to choose a sport. I chose Baseball. Never the less my athletic background is littered with experience. Hobbies include Football, Basketball, Golf, Snowboarding, Swimming, Ping Pong (yes its a sport if you play it correctly), Skating, Etc... "Jack of All Trades" Master of none and thats only because I refuse to say I've mastered anything. Always learning. Always teaching. And always open minded.</p><p> The struggle is real and I am here in your corner till the end. With that said "The End"
